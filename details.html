        <h2>Sippi Arsuang â€“ Travel Info</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Sippi Arsuang is one of the highest peaks in Bangladesh with a height of approximately 2939 feet which
                is the 10th highest peak in Bangladesh. SippiArsuang Hill is located in the foothills of Roangchhari
                Upazila in the Bandarban District of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several neighborhoods can be seen from Sippy including Shankhamuni Para. There was a British camp at the
                top of Sippi or before. On the way to Roninpara, you have to go down a steep hill, from which you can
                see Sippy.

            <p>From Dhaka, you will get buses to reach Bandarban, get off at Bandarban, freshen up, take a local bus
                to Roangchhari and get off at Roangchhari bus stand. If the guide is fixed in advance, the guide
                will wait for you at the bus stand.Buy good grip sandals and other essentials for walking in the hills
                from Roangchhari Bazaar.From Roangchhari you have to go first to Roninpara which is 26 km away. If you
                want, you can also go by car to the moon. Report to the army camp and police station of Roangchhari and
                go to Roninpara with the guide.

            <p>Very few people go to Sippy. Most of those who go, go the first route. This path is familiar and a little
                easier. From Bandarban you have to go to Roangchhari first. It will take about 3 hours to reach
                Paikshang from Roangchhari. It will take about 2.40 hours from Paikshang Para to Ronin Para. It will
                take about 4 hours to reach Sippy Peak from Ronin Para.
